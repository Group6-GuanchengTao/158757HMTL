				<h1>About us</h1>
				<p>
					<b>Company Background</b> 
					Interplanetary Exploration Technologies is a leading global virtual space company dedicated to advancing human exploration and the development of innovative technologies and solutions in space. Our mission is to turn human dreams into reality and open a new chapter in human exploration of the universe.
					<!-- I started this nonprofit adopt a star program in January 2008 to help raise research funds for the Kepler/TESS Asteroseismic Science Consortium, a large international team of scientists. Our work is central to the science goals of the Kepler and TESS missions, but NASA is not allowed to fund foreign organizations—that’s why we need your support! -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Advanced technology</b> 
					Star Quest Technologies brings together a passionate and creative team of the world's top scientists, engineers and technologists. We focus on the development and application of advanced technologies in the fields of spacecraft design, aerospace engineering, planetary science, cosmic physics, artificial intelligence and space resources development.
					 <!-- NASA launched the Kepler space telescope in 2009. It targeted nearly 200,000 stars in the summer Milky Way, followed by 300,000 stars all around the sky. Some of the stars have planets, and some of those planets pass directly in front of their star. We determine the sizes and ages of these planetary systems by measuring the properties of their stars. Kepler has stopped collecting new observations, but TESS launched in April 2018 to survey nearly the entire sky. We have a lot of work to do! -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Explore uncharted territory</b> 
					Interplanetary exploration technology is dedicated to exploring unknown areas in space, including planet and satellite exploration, resource development, space ecosystem research and human habitation environment construction. We believe that by delving deeper into space, we can provide ground-breaking innovations and insights for scientific, technological and social development here on Earth.
					<!-- We are professional astronomers, and this program is run by a 501c3 nonprofit organization. You can feel confident that your donation will support cutting-edge research on the stars that you adopt. So adopt a star and support our work! Who knows? Maybe an Earth-like planet will be found around the star that you adopt—how cool would that be? -->
				</p>
				<p>
					<b>Global cooperation</b> 
					Interplanetary Exploration Technologies actively promotes international cooperation and cross-boundary exchanges, and builds close partnerships with space agencies, research institutes, higher education institutions and the private sector around the world. By sharing knowledge, resources and technology, we are committed to jointly advancing the development of the space sector and realizing mankind's deep exploration of the universe.
					<!-- After you send the application, a few minutes our Automated system will receive your message and then you can check your Star in Google Sky. -->
